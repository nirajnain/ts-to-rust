# TypeScript to Rust

Your Rust adventure starts here!

We will be taking a simple TypeScript application and converting it to Rust to show:

* The similarities and differences
* Pros and cons
* The ultimate thinking about Rust

<br/>

## Surpises!
* let is mutable
* Return type required
* Functions take ownership of parameters
* Exceptions have to be handled
* Strings are a rabbit hole...

## Similarities & Differences
* const vs let
* var vs mut
* camelCase vs 
* function vs fn
* return and ;
* struct vs class
* Trailing commas
* Common types
* import vs use
* Discrimated Unions vs Enums
* Nullables vs Option
* Exceptions vs Result
* No method overloading*
* No built in constructors
* Default heap vs stack allocation

## The Hard Parts
* Ownership & Borrowing
* References
* Options and Results

## Cool Parts
* Runtime Safety Guarantees
* C++ Performance
